"The process of preparing software for translation is called "
"internationalization, or i18n for short. Internationalization makes sure "
"that the software is designed in a way that makes it easy to translate "
"into different languages without having to modify the source code, or in "
"our case, the source files of the guide."
msgstr ""

#: ../../TRANSLATING.md:14
msgid ""
"Sphinx, the documentation engine we use to build the Python Package "
"Guide, has built-in support for internationalization and localization, so"

"The process of actually translating the software into different languages"
